Quickstart Oscilloscope

A two channel oscilloscope implemented using the Stellaris
microcontroller's analog-to-digital converter (ADC).  The oscilloscope
supports sample rates of up to 1M sample per second and will show the
captured waveforms on the color STN display.  On-screen menus provide user
control over timebase, channel voltage scale and position, trigger type,
trigger level and trigger position.  Other features include the ability
to save captured data as comma-separated-value files suitable for use with
spreadsheet applications or bitmap images on either an installed microSD
card or a USB flash drive.  The board may also be connected to a WindowsXP
or Vista host system and controlled remotely using a Windows application.

Oscilloscope User Interface

All oscilloscope controls and settings are accessed using the navigation
control on the board.  This control offers up, down, left, right and select
functions in a single unit.  Rocking the control in the desired direction
sends ``up'', ``down'', ``left'' or ``right'' messages to the application
and pressing on the center sends a ``select'' message.

Controls and settings are arranged into groups by function such as display
settings, trigger settings, file operations and setup choices.  These
groups are accessed by pressing ``select'' to display the main menu.  With
the menu displayed, use ``up'' and ``down'' to select between the available
groups.  When the desired group is highlighted, press ``select'' once again
to dismiss the menu.

Controls from the currently selected group are shown in the bottom portion
of the application display.  Use ``up'' and ``down'' to cycle through the
controls in the group and ``left'' and ``right'' to change the value of, or
select the action associated with the control which is currently
displayed.

The control groups and the individual controls offered by each are
outlined below:

                         screen showing oscilloscope connection help.
           Channel 1     Pressing "left" or "right" will cause the scale
                         and position for the channel 1 waveform to be set
                         such that the waveform is visible on the display.
           Channel 2     Pressing "left" or "right" will cause the scale
                         and position for the channel 2 waveform to be set
                         such that the waveform is visible on the display.

Oscilloscope Connections

The 8 pins immediately above the color STN display panel offer connections
for both channels of the oscilloscope and also two test signals that can be
used to provide input in the absence of any other suitable signals.  Each
channel input must lie in the range -16.5V to +16.5V relative to the board
ground allowing differences of up to 33V to be measured.

The connections are as follow where pin 1 is the leftmost pin, nearest the
microSD card socket:

 1    Test 1      A test signal connected to one side of the speaker on
                  the board.
 2    Channel 1+  This is the positive connection for channel 1 of the
                  oscilloscope.
 3    Channel 1-  This is the negative connection for channel 1 of the
                  oscilloscope.
 4    Ground      This is connected to board ground.
 5    Test 2      A test signal connected to the board Status LED which
                  is driven from PWM0.  This signal is configured to
                  provide a 1KHz square wave.
 6    Channel 2+  This is the positive connection for channel 2 of the
                  oscilloscope.
 7    Channel 2-  This is the negative connection for channel 2 of the
                  oscilloscope.
 8    Ground      This is connected to board ground.

Triggering and Sample Rate Notes

The oscilloscope can sample at a maximum combined rate of 1M samples
per second.  When both channels are enabled, therefore, the maximum
sample rate on each channel is 500K samples per second.  For maximum
resolution at the lowest timebases (maximum samples rates), disable
channel 2 if it is not required.  These sample rates give usable waveform
capture for signals up to around 100KHz.

Trigger detection is performed in software during ADC interrupt handling.
At the highest sampling rates, this interrupt service routine consumes
almost all the available CPU cycles when searching for trigger conditions.
At these sample rates, if a trigger level is set which does not correspond
to a voltage that is ever seen in the trigger channel signal, the user
interface response can become sluggish.  To combat this, the oscilloscope
will abort any pending waveform capture operation if a key is pressed
before the capture cycle as completed.  This prevents the user interface
from being locked out and allows the trigger level or type to be changed
to values more appropriate for the signal being measured.

File Operations

Comma-separated-value or bitmap files representing the last waveform
captured may be saved to either a microSD card or a USB flash drive.
In each case, the files are written to the root directory of the microSD
card or flash drive with file names of the form ``scopeXXX.csv'' or
``scopeXXX.bmp'' where ``XXX'' represents the lowest, three digit, decimal
number which offers a file name which does not already exist on the
device.

Companion Application

A companion application, LMScope, which runs on WindowsXP and Vista PCs
and the required device driver installer are available on the software CD
and via download from the TI Stellaris web site at
http://focus.ti.com/mcu/docs/mcuorphan.tsp?contentId=87903.  This
application offers full control of the oscilloscope from the PC and allows
waveform display and save to local hard disk.

Note that the USB device drivers for the oscilloscope device must be
installed prior to running the LMScope application.  If the drivers are not
installed when LMScope is run, the application will report that various
required DLLs including lmusbdll.dll and winusb.dll are missing.  To install
the drivers, make sure that the USB mode is set to ``Device'' in the Setup
menu then connect the ek-lm3s3748 board to a PC via the ``USB Device''
connector.  This will cause Windows to prompt for device driver
installation.  The required driver can be found on the kit installation
CD or in the ``SW-USB-windrivers-xxxx'' package downloadable from the
software update web site.
